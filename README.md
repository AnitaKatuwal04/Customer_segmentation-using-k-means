This project implements customer segmentation for a mall's dataset using the K-Means clustering algorithm. By clustering customers based on their purchasing behavior, we aim to provide insights that can help the mall better understand its clientele and tailor marketing strategies.

Features
-Customer Segmentation: Group customers based on features such as annual income, spending score, and other relevant attributes.
-Visualizations: Scatter plots, cluster centroids, and Elbow method visualization for selecting the optimal number of clusters.
-Data Processing: Handles missing data, feature scaling, and normalization.
-K-Means Algorithm: Implements K-Means clustering.
